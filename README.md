# TheSnakeGame

# About the Program
This program is a standard snake game where the player controls the snake to reach the target and increase its length. The player must take care to avoid the snake from colliding with the rest of the length of the body.
	
# CONTROLS
•	The basic controls are the arrow keys on the computer keyboard.
•	The arrow keys – UP,DOWN,LEFT, and RIGHT are used to control the direction in which the snake moves.
	
# OBJECTIVE:
•	The objective is to direct the snake to the target and thus move ahead in the level.
•	As  the level increases the speed of the snake also increases, and so does the difficulty.
